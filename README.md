- Vanilla JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API

## 📦 How It Works

1. The user enters a **city name** in the input field.
2. When the **"Get Weather"** button is clicked:
   - JavaScript sends a **fetch request** to the OpenWeatherMap API.
   - The API returns the weather data in JSON format.
   - The data is displayed dynamically on the page.
3. If the city is not found or there's an error, a message is shown.
